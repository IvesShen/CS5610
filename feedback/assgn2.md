Hey,

Looks like you didn't commit a login page. 

Also it seems you've mixed up placeholders and values in some places, here's a few spots:

- http://localhost:5000/assignment/profile.html
- http://localhost:5000/assignment/website-edit.html
- http://localhost:5000/assignment/widget-image.html

Technically you should lose points for incorrect placeholders, but I'll give you full marks since it can be confusing.
You should fix on the next assigment or I'll have to take points off.

score: 80/88 (-8 due to missing login page. Email Ming and ask her if it's okay to submit the login page for grading. I'm pretty sure she will say yes)
